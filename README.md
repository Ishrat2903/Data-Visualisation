# Data-Visualisation

### Explanatory Data Analysis Project
Welcome to my Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this endeavor, I have taken on the role of a data science consultant, working closely with a client company to uncover valuable insights from their dataset through data visualization and analysis. 
This project revolves around building a comprehensive EDA pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook to present compelling and actionable data-driven insights.

### Project Overview
In this project, I have followed a structured approach to deliver meaningful insights and recommendations to our client company. The key components of this project include:
  1. Business and Data Visualization Context
  2. Data Exploration
  3. Data Preprocessing
  4. Explanatory Data Visualization
  5. Final Discussion and Conclusion
This project underscores my commitment to delivering actionable insights and helping businesses make informed decisions through data analysis and visualization.
Feel free to explore the project in detail and reach out with any questions or feedback.
It's my hope that this EDA pipeline serves as a valuable resource for similar endeavors in the field of data science and consulting.
